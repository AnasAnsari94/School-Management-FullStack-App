üè´ School Management System ‚Äì DevOps-Enabled Full-Stack Project
üìò Overview

The School Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage student attendance, teachers, and administrative tasks efficiently.
Originally a traditional MERN-style app, it has been enhanced with end-to-end DevOps automation, including containerization (Docker), multi-service orchestration (Docker Compose), and automated CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI/CD with GitLab Runner) running locally.

This project showcases how a complete full-stack system can be built, tested, and deployed automatically in a local environment using modern DevOps tools.

üß∞ Tech Stack
Frontend

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend

üöÄ DevOps Implementation
üê≥ Dockerization

Created a single Dockerfile at the project root that builds and runs both frontend and backend.

Used multi-stage builds to optimize image size.

Configured environment variables via .env file for flexible setup.

‚öôÔ∏è Docker Compose

Created a docker-compose.yml file to manage multiple services:

app ‚Üí Built from root Dockerfile (frontend + backend)

mongo ‚Üí Official MongoDB image

Established a shared Docker network for inter-service communication.

Enabled volume mapping for MongoDB persistence.

üîÅ GitLab CI/CD Integration

Configured .gitlab-ci.yml with stages for build, test, and deploy.

Git pushes trigger automatic Docker builds and container restarts.

Used GitLab Runner on the local machine to simulate a production CI/CD pipeline.

Added an after_script section for cleanup and re-deployment of containers.

üíª Local Deployment (via GitLab Runner)

Installed and registered GitLab Runner locally.

Pipeline automatically:

Pulls latest code from GitLab

Builds Docker images

Deploys containers via docker-compose up --build

Provides a local CI/CD environment similar to real-world infrastructure.

üßæ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/school-management-system.git
cd school-management-system

2. Build and start containers
docker-compose up --build

4. Stop containers
docker-compose down

5. Run CI/CD Pipeline

Push changes to GitLab ‚Üí pipeline triggers ‚Üí GitLab Runner builds and redeploys containers automatically.

OR

if you want to run this application manually by Dockerfile
for that 
you have to create a docker network with name school-network
then you have to build mongo image for MongoDB locally

For Running this application without docker-compose you have to run these commands

# create network
docker network create school-network

# run mongo
docker run -d --name school_mongo --network school-network -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo:6.0

# build image for app
docker build -t school_app_image .

# run app (linking to mongo via network)
docker run -d --name school_app --network school-network -p 5000:5000 \
  -e MONGO_URI=mongodb://school_mongo:27017/school \
  -e PORT=5000 \
  school_app_image
